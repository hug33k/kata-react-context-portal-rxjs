# Kata React Context / Portal & RxJS

## Description

I wanted to learn more about React Context and Portals, so I decided to create a small app that uses them.
I also wanted to learn more about RxJS, so I decided to use it as well.

## Features

- Front
    - Theme handled by React Context
    - Modal for theme management/edition handled by React Portal
    - Sync between Front & Back using RxJS
- Back
    - Simple API using Express
    - Themes stored as files
    - CRUD for themes

## Usage

### Front

```bash
cd front
npm install
npm start
```

### Back

```bash
cd back
npm install
npm start
```

## TODO

- Refactor & Clean code
